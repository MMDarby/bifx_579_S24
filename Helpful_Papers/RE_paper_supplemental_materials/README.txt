This directory contains the supplemental materials from Widespread Splicing of Repetitive Element Loci into Coding Regions of Gene Transcripts

SupplementaryTable4 contains a summary of the different types of repetitive elements that were expressed in the brain.

SupplementaryTable5 gives a summary of the different types of repetitive elements that are annotated in the genome.

SupplementaryTable11-2 gives a list of repetitive elements with at least one splice junction in an intronic or intergenic region expressed in the brain

SupplementaryTable12 gives a list of repetitive elements with at least one splice junction in an intronic or intergenic region expressed in the blood

SupplementaryTable25 gives the coordinates and supporting read depth of novel exons containing repetitive elements expressed in the human brain as well as the exons immediately before and after the novel exon.

SupplementaryTable26 give the coordinates, sequence, and possible amino acid translations of novel exons containing repetitive elements that are expressed in the human brain

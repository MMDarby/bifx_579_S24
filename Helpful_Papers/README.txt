This directory contains the following useful papers:
#1 Widespread Splicing of Repetitive Elements - This is the original paper that describes our discovery of thousands of novel exons expressed in the human brain.
#2 The Recount3 paper - This paper describes the Recount3 resource and the convenience functions for accessing it.
#3 Discovery and Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Novel Splice-junction Peptides Using RNA-Seq - This is a paper that does a similar thing to what we want to do - we want to take a genomic sequence and make spectra out of it. We don't need to do the RNA part first.

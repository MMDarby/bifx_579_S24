This directory contains some old scripts that were used to graph the number of sequencing reads aligning to various genomic coordiates. Some are for plotting genomic regions that overlap repetitive elements and some are for plotting whole genes. 

To test these scripts, students can access some old .bam files on the BIFX server here: /BIODATA/mouseDataForSplicingProject/mouseBams

# bifx_579_S24
BIFX 579 Spring 2024 Repository

This repository contains code written by students in the Spring 2024 capstone course. 
Students attempted to create the following tools, which are described in Projects2024.ppt:

1) A tool to measure gene expression of a region denoted by genomic coordinates (i.e. chr2:123456-123456_+)
   across a selection of bigWig files downloaded from the Recount3 database (https://rna.recount.bio/)
2) A tool to find the edges of a novel exon using split read data from Snapcount (2 different methods)
3) A tool to determine whether a novel isoform undergos nonsense mediate decay or could produce a protein
4) A tool to generate a fasta with the amino acid sequenc for each novel isoform as well as annotated isoforms
   from the same gene. (This tool relies on some assumptions that we need to fix by determining full length isoforms.)
5) A tool to generate 3D models of the novel protein isoform and compare it to annotated isoforms
6) A tool to predict GO annotations of a novel protein isoform based on sequence
